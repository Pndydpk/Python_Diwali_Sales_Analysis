MegaMarket's Diwali Sales: Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

Welcome to MegaMarket's Diwali Sales EDA project! Here, we delve into the rich dataset provided by MegaMarket to gain insights into their sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance during the festive season.

Using Python's powerful data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we embark on a journey to uncover patterns, anomalies, and correlations within the data. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to answer critical questions about MegaMarket's Diwali sales, including:

2. How does gender influence the purchasing behavior across different age groups?

State Analysis:

1. Which states exhibit the highest sales and order volumes during Diwali?
2. What are the top-performing states in terms of sales and orders?

Marital Status Analysis:

1. What is the marital status distribution among the buyers?
2. How does marital status correlate with purchasing power, especially among females?

Occupation Analysis:

1. What are the dominant occupational sectors among buyers?
2. Which occupations contribute the most to overall sales during Diwali?

Product Category Analysis:

2. Which product categories attract the highest sales revenue?

Product ID Analysis:
